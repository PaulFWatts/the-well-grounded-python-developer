The "my_code" directory contains the code that I wrote while reading the book based on the examples directory. The code is organized by chapter, and each chapter has its own directory. The code is written in Python.

Create a virtual environment and install the requirements using the following commands:
`py -m venv .venv`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
